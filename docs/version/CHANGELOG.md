# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.6.1]

### Changed
- Added 1.21.6 as an option for version selection.

### Fixed
- An odd issue with some mods selecting the wrong version for updating -- the mod in question was Terra Prety, but I'm sure the issue went unnoticed with other mods as well.

## [v0.6.0]

### Added
- Added an Ignore column and matching logic to ignore checking for updates on specific mods in the event a new version of a mod causes issues, but an older version works fine.
- Added 1.21.5 as an option for version selection.

### Changed
- Slightly increased the window size to accomodate the new column.
- Reworded some comments for clarity.
- Possible other changes to code I forgot about, it's been awhile between making these changes and pushing the update.

## [v0.5.2]

### Added
- Added support for specific game versions ranging from 1.20.0 to 1.21.4.

### Changed
- Improved version selection logic to recognize and handle exact versions such as 1.21.1 and 1.21.2.

---

## [v0.5.1] - 9-20-2025

### Added
- Integrated NuGet.Versioning to improve semantic version sorting.

### Fixed
- Corrected update logic so that stable releases are always preferred (when available) over pre-release versions like -pre.2 or -rc.1.

---

## [v0.5.0] - 9-20-2025

### Added
- Added a button to copy the entire mod list (useful for quickly sharing in places like a Discord server).

### Changed
- Improved the mod update check to run in parallel instead of sequentially, making it roughly 4–5x faster compared to v0.4.0.
- Refactored backend logic related to how/when mod update checks are processed.

---

## [v0.4.0] - 09-18-2025

### Added
- MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.SimpleIcons for better brand icons.  
- Mod Page column to the mods table.  
- Ability to click mod page icons to open the corresponding mod page in a browser.  
- Tooltips added or improved for: Refresh Mods Folder, Browse for Mods Folder, Buy Me a Coffee, Check for Updates, Update column checkmark, and Mod Page icons.  
- Markdown copy output for updated mods, making it easier to paste directly into Discord.  
- App Icon for a more polished look.  
- The app now remembers the last loaded mods folder, so you only need to select it once.  

### Changed
- Discord button replaced with a Buy Me a Coffee button.  
- "Has Update"*column renamed to "Update".  
- Update column now displays a checkmark icon instead of a checkbox control.  
- Compiler warnings cleaned up (~20 resolved).

  - .NET 8 is no longer bundled with the app (assumed to be installed separately).  
  - File size reduced from ~70MB → ~10MB.  

### Fixed
- Issue with checking for mod updates after files were removed from the active folder.  
  - The app now refreshes the folder before update checks, preventing file-not-found errors.  

### Removed
- MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.FontAwesome
- Redundant"Update" header above the update button.

### Added
- Game version selection dropdown for finding the most recent mod updates by [major.minor](https://semver.org) version (e.g. `1.21.x`).

- Updated Newtonsoft.Json from 13.0.3 → 13.0.4.
